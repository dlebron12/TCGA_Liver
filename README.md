# TCGA_Liver

This data comes from the TCGA portal under the Liver Hepatocellular carcinoma 
https://cancergenome.nih.gov/cancersselected/LiverHepatocellularCarcinoma.

Here I do a analysis based on three objectives:
1. Understanding what variables increases odds of having this cancer.
2. Observing differences in bacterial/viruses abundances in tumor/non-tumor samples.
3. Creating personalized risk assessment models based on (1) and (2). 

Work done as an Independent Study project.
